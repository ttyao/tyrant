				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we welcome back <a href="https://plus.google.com/101848022626876111829/about" target="_blank">Jordi Ordóñez</a>, a PrestaShop Community member (<a style="font-style: italic" href="http://www.prestashop.com/forums/user/145757-jordiob/" target="_blank">jordiob</a>) and owner of Barcelona-based website <a href="http://jordiob.com/" target="_blank">http://jordiob.com/</a>.

<span id="more-19487"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-19488" style="margin-right: 0" alt="Jordi Ordóñez" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/01/Jordi-Ordóñez.jpg" width="235" height="207" /></p>
<p>After a long break from writing on PrestaShop’s blog, I’m happy to have the opportunity to talk about PrestaShop and SEO again. Today we’re going to focus on Google Panda penalizations and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>Google initially released the Panda algorithm in February 2011. The goal of this algorithm was to penalize and kill low quality sites (websites with copy-pasted, low quality content and thin content) and drop their search engine rankings.</p>
<h2 style="color:#00933B">How do I know if my site is affected by Panda?</h2>
<p>I call Panda “the silent killer.” Unlike Google Penguin’s dramatic and instant traffic drop, Panda drops your organic traffic slowly. It’s why you need to closely monitor your organic traffic if you think it might be affecting you. Let’s take a look at a how Google’s Penguin and Panda penalties drop your web traffic:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19489" alt="Google panda vs Google penguin" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/01/Google-panda-vs-Google-penguin.png" width="560" height="273" /></p>
<p>As you can see, Penguin is an instant-killer, while Panda is a mid to long term traffic killer. You won’t notice a Panda penalty as quickly as a Penguin one, and by then it might be too late.</p>
<p>Because your traffic doesn’t dramatically drop from one day to another (only in extreme cases), you’ll need daily reports on organic traffic from <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/analytics-stats-prestashop-modules/4168-ganalytics.html">Google Analytics</a> (or another tool). From an ecommerce standpoint, Penguin force you to close your online business faster than Panda might. Also, recovering from a Penguin hit is more complicated than recovering from a Panda penalization.</p>
<p>So, how can you tell if your site is affected? Watch out for drops in organic traffic, even small ones. It may be hard to detect because your organic traffic will show a slow down over several weeks.</p>
<p>My good friend and SEO consultant <a href="http://www.mjcachon.es/" target="_blank">MJ Cachon</a> has introduced me to some great free tools that you can use too: <a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.barracuda-digital.co.uk/panguin-tool/">Panguin</a>, <a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://feinternational.com/website-penalty-indicator/" target="_blank">Website Penalty Indicator</a> or <a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://suite.searchmetrics.com/en/research/domains/organic" target="_blank">SearchMetrics</a>.</p>
<p>Another powerful free tool is <a style="font-weight: bold" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033021?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Analytics alert</a> function. Set daily alerts to know at what rate your organic traffic is dropping each day.</p>
<h2 style="color:#00933B">So, what’s wrong with my PrestaShop store?</h2>
<p>Well, let’s see what baby Panda likes to eat (besides grass):</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Thin content</li>
<li>Poor content</li>
<li>Duplicated content</li>
<li>Massive 404 errors</li>
<li>Low quality links</li>
<li>Keyword stuffing</li>
<li>Content for search engines, not people</li>
<li>Page speed</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what’s at the core of Panda’s algorithm. But, in case you want to investigate in-depth how it works, Bill Slawski at SEO by the sea gives an explanation of the <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2014/09/new-panda-update-new-panda-patent/">patents developed and acquired by Google</a> make Panda what it is.</p>
<h2 style="color:#00933B">How can I rebound from the Panda Penalty?</h2>
<p>Find out how to fix your problems by asking and answering the questions below. Be honest: your traffic depends on it.</p>
<h4 style="color:#3369E8">Do I have poor or thin content on my site?</h4>
<p>This is especially important on product and category pages as well as your <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/content-marketing-for-ecommerce-technical-checklist-writing-process/">blog</a> (if you don’t have one, you should!). Keep in mind that search engines value content above all, so always create original, meaningful and useful content. Never copy-paste text provided by your distributor, wholesaler or manufacturer. <a href="http://siteliner.com/" target="_blank">Siteliner</a> is great tool to help you visualize overall content quality on your ecommerce site; it displays the percentage of duplicated, common and original content on your site.</p>
<p>If you need to fix large amounts of poor content and you’re already selling, with little time to spare, consider <a style="font-style: italic" href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/web-agency-partners">hiring someone</a> to do it. Never&#8211;let me be clear here&#8211;NEVER trust cheap services for your content curation. If you’ve been hit by Panda, hiring someone that DOES NOT write useful and original stuff can lead you to a worst hit.</p>
<h4 style="color:#3369E8">Do I have massive 404 errors on my site?</h4>
<p>Crawl your site using <a href="http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/" target="_blank">Screamingfrog</a> or <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html" target="_blank">Xenu</a> to check how many 404 errors you have and fix them. And, of course, use <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2409439?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Webmaster Tools</a> to keep track of the 404 errors and use <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93641?hl=en">Google guidelines</a> to create useful 404 pages. Be careful when deleting or deactivating products and categories on your shop. Always redirect expired products (with 301 redirects) to the parent category or to a similar product. Do the same with category pages.</p>
<h4 style="color:#3369E8">Do I have low-quality links pointing to my website?</h4>
<p>Fixing this issue is more complicated, and finding a free tool to intensely evaluate backlink quality is difficult. I suggest using <a href="https://majestic.com/" target="_blank">Majestic</a>, <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank">Ahrefs</a> or <a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/" target="_blank">Moz’s Open Site Explorer</a> to make a first assessment and determine if your links are good or bad. If you think you have a serious problem, take action using the best tools: <a href="http://www.linkdetox.com/" target="_blank">Link Detox</a> and the Disavow Tool in Google Webmaster Tools. Two quick tips:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>If more than 5% of the links have the same exact keyword (let’s say: buy ebooks online) in the anchor text, you’ve been exposed! (Use Majestic’s free anchor text report to see if this is your case)</li>
<li>Avoid low-quality links like link farms and networks, footer links, blogrolls, link blocks, site-wide links, blog comments, forum comments, forum profile links and signatures, web directories and article directories.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color:#3369E8">Have I been keyword-stuffing my ecommerce website?</h4>
<p>Well, that’s an easy one. Have you been over-optimizing your PrestaShop pages by filling them with repeated keywords? If the answer is “yes” or “well… maybe,” then you did.</p>
<p>Start rewriting your pages with proper content. Do not repeat the same keyword more than 3 times per page, especially if your content is short. Google knows what you’re doing, so no more funny business!</p>
<h4 style="color:#3369E8">Have I been writing content for search engines, not people?</h4>
<p>Another easy one. Have you been writing stuff for humans or robots? Again, if the answer is “yes” or “well… maybe,” then yes. Or do what I call the “mama test” &#8211; if your mama can’t understand what you’re writing about or what you’re selling, you’re better off rewriting that content. Remember, real people are buying your stuff, not Google.</p>
<h4 style="color:#3369E8">And last but not least: Is my page speed slower than a love song?</h4>
<p>If so, you need to improve it. Use the performance options under the preferences tab on your back office to speed up PrestaShop store. Next try reducing image sizes, moving your shop to a dedicated server, assessing your web server with the TTFB (Time to First Byte) metric, using Content Delivery Networks to reduce the average load time of images, CSS and JavaScript or even purchasing a caching module from <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/search?search_query=cache">PrestaShop’s Addons Store</a>.</p>
<h2 style="color:#00933B">Bonus: Tips for PrestaShop websites</h2>
<p>Yes, I’m a proud PrestaShop user, and have been for the last 4 years. So I have hands on knowledge of how PrestaShop works. Here are some additional tips that might help you avoid an instant SEO death:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><strong>Keep your robots.txt healthy.</strong> Avoid EVERY non useful parameter, especially the ones created by the layered navigation module.</li>
<li><strong>Check your sitemap regularly</strong> and do not include non-useful pages such as cart, order, login, address, addresses, voucher, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful when importing CSV files.</strong> Include the product creation date, otherwise products can be created in 1.969, which generates errors on Google Webmaster Tools’ sitemap.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful when creating CDN subdomains.</strong> Sometimes (when not created properly), they duplicate the content, so double and triple check it.</li>
<li><strong>Always speed up your site</strong> once it’s live, use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank">Google Page Speed</a> tool and <a href="http://gtmetrix.com/" target="_blank">GTMetrix.com</a> to create useful reports about what can be improved.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve added all your products and put the finishing touches on your PrestaShop store design. Today is the day you take your store out of maintenance mode. You refresh your homepage but all you see is a blank page for 1… 2… 3… 4… whole seconds!</p>
<p>As excited as you are, a question lingers at the back of your mind: “Why did my online store take so long to load?”<br />
<span id="more-19479"></span><br />
It’s a question many merchants find themselves asking, and the answer is quite simple. The PrestaShop performance settings optimized for website development aren’t the same for page load speed. With PrestaShop, it’s easy to switch your shop’s configurations from development-friendly to speed-optimized. So today we share some quick and easy settings to speed up your PrestaShop store. As an added bonus, we explain how each setting works.</p>
<p>Start by logging into your PrestaShop back office, and navigating to ADVANCED PARAMETERS &gt; PERFORMANCE</p>
<h2 style="color: #71bd39">Smarty Tab</h2>
<p>There you’ll see the <strong>SMARTY</strong> tab, which corresponds to your theme or template. (<a href="http://www.smarty.net/" target="_blank">Smarty</a> is the template language used on PrestaShop themes.)</p>
<p><strong>Template Compilation:</strong> This setting determines whether the website has to recompile its instructions. Why does a theme have instructions? The PrestaShop default template is built to be flexible and customizable to meet the needs of any online merchant. With that said, our design elements are not static; each design module connects to your shop with its own set of template instructions. It’s how you can customize our default template to make it your own.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>[X] Never recompile template files</strong> – (Fastest) Select this if you are completely satisfied with the design and are done editing files.<br />
<strong>[ ] Recompile templates if the files have been updated</strong> – (Fast) Choose this option if you’re a developer-merchant who makes regular theme edits to the website. The page will only recompile if changes have been made to theme files.<br />
<strong>[ ] Force compilation</strong> – (Slow) Only use this setting while you’re debugging the website. Each time the page loads, the theme re-determines which elements should be displayed and how.</p>
<p><strong>Cache:</strong> A <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/cache" target="_blank">cache</a> refers to temporarily stored files that increase performance and reduce delays.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>[X] YES</strong> – Once you’re done customizing your front office theme, turn on this option to improve your website’s performance for customers.<br />
<strong>[ ] NO</strong> – The only time you don’t use caching is when you’re actively working on your theme. If you don’t have this option disabled, you won’t see the changes you’ve made immediately. When you’re developing the theme, clear your cache to ensure the changes are reflected on the webpage.</p>
<p><strong>Caching Type: File System or MySQL</strong> – Because this setting’s configuration varies from shop to shop, there is no definitive answer when deciding which is better. It really depends on the size of your database, along with its configuration and optimization. If you have a small database, it’ll be difficult to notice any difference.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Cache:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>[ ] Never clear cache files</strong> – Select this option if you want to stop clearing the cache altogether. This is useful if you are doing a lot of modifications, or some bulk actions like a CSV import: you wouldn’t want the cache to be cleared constantly. Be sure to turn this option off when you are done; or clear your cache manually.<br />
<strong>[X] Clear cache every time something has been modified</strong> &#8211; It does exactly what it says. Your website’s cache will be cleared once something changes. This ensures your customers see the most updated version of your website.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> If you want even more control over how often and which pages are cached, download our premium community developed <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/seo-prestashop-modules/6413-cache-manager.html" target="_blank">Cache Manager</a> from PrestaShop Addons.</p>
<h2 style="color: #71bd39">Optional Features</h2>
<p>Turning off the following features may speed up your website, but barely. They also limit PrestaShop’s features and restrict you from using the software to its full potential.<br />
Please note, if these options are grayed out and you can’t disable then, you’re already using the feature.</p>
<h2 style="color: #71bd39">CCC (Combine, Compress and Cache)</h2>
<p>CCC is a set of tools aimed at minimizing website loading time. Here’s what it does:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic">CCC combines similar text files into one bigger file, which limits the number of files to download; then compresses the file using the common Zip algorithm, which speeds downloads. Finally, it caches the compressed file, eliminating the need to perform this process each time a page loads, relieving the burden on the server&#8217;s processor.</p>
<p>Beware some of these settings may distort your theme, so be sure to turn them on one at time. And as always, be sure to test your website after making any changes.</p>
<p><strong>Smart cache for CSS: [YES]</strong> &#8211; Combine, compress and cache CSS type files.<br />
<strong>Smart cache for JavaScript*: [YES]</strong> &#8211; Combine, compress and cache JavaScript type files.<br />
<strong>Minify HTML: [YES]</strong> – This configuration removes all the white spaces in the HTML code generated from the Smarty Template.<br />
<strong>Compress inline JavaScript* in HTML: [YES]</strong> – If you’re using JavaScripts in your theme, compress them so they load faster.<br />
<strong>Move JavaScript* to the end: [YES]</strong> &#8211; Moving the JavaScript to the end forces it to load last, allowing your webpage to load the simpler elements of your website first.</p>
<p>*These settings affect JavaScript, which is sometimes used in theme development and can distort your theme.</p>
<h2 style="color: #71bd39">It’s your turn</h2>
<p>Ready to speed up your PrestaShop store? Here’s a snapshot of configurations for a lightening-fast load time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scenario is common to new, startup businesses. A customer wants to sign up for a recurring service or products. You’re left wondering what the best solution would be to ensure they get charged in a timely, reliable manner. Like many small business owners, you don’t have the time to set a calendar remind to ask for payment.</p>
<p>Instead, services like auto-recurring billing can be your best friend. With auto-recurring billing, you can automate your subscription reordering process so you never forget to bill customers again.</p>
<p>To provide you more importation on auto-recurring billing, we’ve turned to one of our online payment partners, Simplify Commerce about the basics of auto-recurring billing for online stores and how to set up auto-recurring billing using their free online payment module.<br />
<span id="more-19444"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #ff6e25">Why would I choose auto-recurring billing?</h2>
<p>Auto-recurring billing or subscription billing allows online merchants to automatically charge customers on a monthly basis for products or services. It’s a great win-win: customers regularly receive products or services; merchants never forget to bill their customers.</p>
<p>Some online merchants who’ve used auto-recurring billing include:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 40px">
<li>Subscriptions boxes</li>
<li>Grocery delivery services</li>
<li>Cleaning services</li>
<li>Rent collection</li>
<li>Gym memberships</li>
<li>Pest control services</li>
<li>Book club subscriptions</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: #ff6e25">How is auto-recurring billing different from up-front billing?</h2>
<p>Auto-recurring billing is great for merchants that provide a recurring service or have recurring shipments. Once auto-recurring billing is configured and scheduled, it practically runs by itself.</p>
<p>Up-front billing is great for merchants providing an on-and-done service or product. Products that fall into this category include furniture, clothing and digital goods. However, with the popularity of subscription boxes and services any online store can leverage auto-recurring billing.</p>
<h2 style="color: #ff6e25">How can online merchants prevent subscription cancellations?</h2>
<p>Although everything is automated, it’s important for business owners to engage with their customers. Use each order as a way to get in touch with your customers. Try sending emails to customers about the service or product they just received. Ask for reviews or encourage them to engage with you on social media. Is there a special holiday coming up? Surprise customers with a little treat to thank them for their continued subscription.</p>
<p>Want another tip for more sales? Increase conversions by including discount coupons in email newsletters.</p>
<h2 style="color: #ff6e25">How to get started today</h2>
<p>Setting up and managing auto-recurring billing is easy with Simplify Commerce. Set up in 5 simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Simplify Commerce from your PrestaShop Back office</li>
<li>Configure your Simplify Commerce module</li>
<li>Log into your Simplify platform</li>
<li>Click &#8220;+New Plan&#8221;</li>
<li>Enter the plan name, cost and the frequency, then click “Add Subscription.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="color: #ff6e25">Sponsored by: Simplify Commerce</h2>
<p>Simplify Commerce, backed by MasterCard (a global leader in the payment industry for decades) is an all-in-one payment solution that enables businesses and non-profits to accept all major credit and debit cards. Their turnkey secure payments solution offers a simple, flat 2.85% + 30₵ rate with no extra fees. They also offer two business day funding and the highest Level 1 PCI Certification.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you’re planning a website redesign. Maybe you’re migrating from one platform to another or upgrading from an old version of your current ecommerce software. In either case, you’re probably up to your ears in fonts and photos, but you can’t forget about your SEO ranking.</p>
<p>To be sure the new version of your online store maintains your current SEO position, you need to prepare a little before you let your developer go to town. Specifically, you’ll need to think about <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>301 redirection</strong>.</p>
<p>In this article, we explain what a site migration is and how to prepare for it, so you have a smooth, successful redesign experience.</p>
<p><span id="more-19435"></span></p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">Who needs to read this article?</h4>
<p>The following advice is aimed primarily at merchants who already have an ecommerce site and are undertaking a redesign.</p>
<p>This article is <strong>not aimed at merchants changing their store domain name</strong>. The SEO work required for that is different.</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">What is site migration?</h4>
<p>Site migration simply means transferring your old site to a new site. If you take the time to develop structure and plan ahead for 301 redirects, you’ll have a smoother transition with the following benefits:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Direct traffic to your old pages will be automatically redirected to your new website.</li>
<li>Links to pages on your old store will not lead to 404 errors.</li>
<li>You guarantee the continuity of your site SEO, which means you’ll hardly notice any drop in traffic after migration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A little structure</h2>
<p>Before going any further, we suggest you read this article on <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/find-the-right-seo-keywords-for-your-online-store/">creating an &#8216;SEO friendly&#8217; structure for an ecommerce site</a>.</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">Designing the structure of your new online store</h4>
<p>A site redesign is the perfect moment to reassess categories and determine which should be kept in the new version of your site and which should be eliminated. The idea is to keep what works and rethink the areas that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The whole point of redesigning your store is to improve upon your old store, so don’t remove categories that bring in SEO traffic and sales. You must recreate those categories in your new store in addition to developing other areas.</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">Improve existing site structure</h4>
<p>Here are some places to find inspiration:</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Take a look at your competitors&#8217; stores. What are they doing right? Carry out a simple benchmarking project and note what works in terms of SEO. Resist the urge to copy and paste. Good SEO demands original content</li>
<li>Revisit your initial semantic analysis and look for more <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/find-the-right-seo-keywords-for-your-online-store/">keywords to target.</a></li>
<li>For merchants who already use AdWords campaigns, <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/template?uid=fEb3DNQXT_-2j8aKs0I9MQ" target="_blank">this report</a> may also be useful. It corresponds to keywords typed by your visitors via AdWords, and not keywords that have been paid for.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">Google Analytics: think of it as a housewarming gift</h4>
<p>Okay, so you’ve done some surfing and revisited your initial keywords. You know you need to change some categories, but what should you replace them with? And how will you know if they’re better than what you already have?</p>

<h2>“This page is no longer at this address”</h2>
<p>So you’ve built the foundation for your new store. Now you need to let the world know where it is. Enter the <strong>301 redirect</strong>.</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">What are 301 redirects?</h4>
<p>When you move house and you want the post office to forward your mail to your new address, you fill out a form that looks something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Old postal address -&gt; New postal address</p>
<p>You have to do the same thing when you move your site, only it’s called a <strong>301 redirect</strong>. When a web page changes URL, you have to tell your server so that all searches can be directed to the new URL:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Old URL -&gt; 301 redirect -&gt; New URL</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">When is a 301 redirect necessary?</h4>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>When an old page disappears entirely&#8211;redirect this page to your home page.</li>
<li>When a page changes URL address&#8211;you need to redirect the old URL to the new URL.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">When is a 301 redirect not necessary?</h4>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>When a URL remains the same in the old and new versions of your site.</li>
<li>When a new page is created within your new structure which did not exist before.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">How to put 301 redirects into place:</h4>
<p><strong>Redirect page by page.</strong> This creates a link between your old structure and the new website. It’s more precise for Google, and it provides a smoother SEO transition.</p>
<p><strong>Redirect all old URLs to your new ecommerce website home page.</strong> This isn’t the most SEO-friendly option, but it’s more appropriate when you have many URLs to migrate or there are no new equivalents for obsolete pages.</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">How to prepare for 301 redirects</h4>
<p>Before your technical team can get to work, you need to prepare your URLs. Here’s how:</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">1. Identify all your site URLs</h4>
<p>Find your site URLs, old and new using a crawler such as <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html" target="_blank">Xenu</a> (free) or <a href="http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/" target="_blank">Screaming Frog SEO</a> (paid).</p>
<p>These tools give you access to the list of URLs from your old and new e-commerce websites and make it easy to export them to an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19436" alt="301 type" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2015/01/301-type.png" width="720" height="132" /></p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">2. Link the two sites</h4>
<p>Display the list of URLs from your former site in one column. These URLs must either be redirected to the new equivalent URL or to the home page.</p>
<p>List the new URLs in a second column.</p>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">3. Integrating the 301s</h4>
<p>If you’re a developer with expert experience in SEO, then by all means integrate the .htaccess file for your new store. Otherwise, I highly recommend that you <strong>call on the expertise of an <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en/web-agency-partners">SEO expert or developer</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>The big day has arrived</h2>
<h4 style="color: #76b32a">When you’re ready to launch your new store:</h4>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
<li>Place your site under maintenance using the 503 code</li>
<li>Publish your new website (containing the 301 redirects in the .htaccess file)</li>
<li>Remove the maintenance code to activate your site.</li>
<li>Test the 301s immediately by typing an old URL; you should be automatically redirected to the new URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to verify that the http header sent by your server to the old URL is actually the 301 code (with this tool for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-http-headers/iaiioopjkcekapmldfgbebdclcnpgnlo?hl=en" target="_blank">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/live-http-headers/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>).</p>
<p>You have successfully completed your migration!</p>
<p>Be aware that <strong>302 codes are not the same as 301 codes</strong>. They are temporary redirects that don’t transmit SEO information. Make sure your developer is aware of this too!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The retail experience is changing as customers turn to their phones, tablets and laptops for their shopping needs. According to a Forrester survey, 70% of shoppers used a mobile phone to research in-store purchases; an MIT report found that 80% check prices online before buying in a store. As a result, the concept of “omni-channel” marketing has replaced more traditional one-to-many marketing techniques.</p>
<p>While some of the most impressive examples of omni-channel marketing are being done by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/jan/15/luxury-retailers-in-store-tech" target="_blank">larger companies</a>, small businesses can use their lessons to improve the customer experience, build loyalty and generate more sales. In today’s post, we’ll explain what omni-channel means and how omni-channel marketing can help your small business.<br />
<span id="more-19451"></span></p>
<h2>Multi-channel vs Cross-Channel vs Omni-channel</h2>
<p>You’ve probably run into a few different words that describe marketing across multiple channels: do multi-channel, cross-channel and omni-channel ring any bells? While they each have their nuances, they have one thing in common&#8211;the end goal. In today’s hyper-connected retail environment, that goal is to create a seamless, consistent and authentic customer experience wherever, whenever and however you sell.</p>
<p>This has given rise to what marketers call “omni-channel retail.” Omni is Latin for “all, or of all things,” and for retailers it means connecting and harmonizing information and experience across all channels in which they are present. The latest evolution in multi-channel strategies, it’s been referred to as everything from “cross-channel done right” to a new retail paradigm (some marketing experts take the idea of omni-channel even further, suggesting that the no-boundaries nature of the strategy implies a <a href="http://omnichannel.me/what-is-omnichannel/" target="_blank">new definition</a> of “your” customer.)</p>
<p>But most importantly, omni-channel implies a complete back-end integration. In practical terms, this means being able to ensure that your customer can do something like look up a product at home online, order it later via smartphone or tablet, and pick it up at a convenient store location on her way home from work.</p>
<h2>Putting omni-channel marketing to work for ecommerce</h2>
<p>Whether you have a 100% online business or several brick-and-mortar stores, you can put omni-channel marketing principles to work to increase visibility, generate more conversions and turn visitors into regular customers. We’ve put together some suggestions to get you started.</p>
<h4 style="color: #46c0d7">Add channels with purpose</h4>
<p>It can be tempting to want to be everywhere at once, right now. Afterall, that’s what customers want right? Well, yes, but what they want even more is a great experience. To give them that, you may need to focus on building a quality presence in one or two channels at first, to justify expanding into others and to guarantee that you do so in the most effective way. Be clear about why you are entering a new channel and what your goal is. If you haven’t mastered day-to-day business on your ecommerce store, you might not be ready to open a physical store just yet.</p>
<h4 style="color: #46c0d7">Build trust through consistency</h4>
<p>One of the building blocks of omni-channel marketing is consistency. Make sure that prices in your online store, across marketplaces and in your physical store (if you have one) are consistent, and that customers have access to the same discounts everywhere. If you’re using targeted discounts to drive people to a specific channel&#8211;exclusive online deals&#8211;make sure that these are clearly indicated so that people know they can trust your prices wherever they shop.</p>
<p>Another element of consistency is projecting a coherent brand image. This could be as simple as making sure your site design matches your flyers at the farmers market where you sell on Saturdays. Or it could mean ensuring that in-store staff have access to the same level of customer order information as online-help staff so that customers receive swift service no matter where they purchased.</p>
<h4 style="color: #46c0d7">Streamline with behind-the-scenes organization</h4>
<p>Inventory is a key consideration in an omni-channel strategy. Many customers use the internet for research before heading to the store to buy; others visit stores to try on items, then go home to order them on their tablet. Be ready to serve them both! If a customer discovers your product online, you need to be sure that it will be available in-store and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Logistics is another area where merchants can reinforce the coherence necessary to pull off an omni-channel strategy. Ensure that customers have options: they’ll be delighted to learn they can pay online and pick up at a physical location, or browse in-store and have their purchase shipped.</p>
<p>Finally, customers expect a fast, simple secure checkout, no matter where they are. And they don’t want any limitations on payment options, so make sure you support everything from cash to a digital wallet, depending on your channels.</p>
<h4 style="color: #46c0d7">Get personal</h4>
<p>With consistency, personalization is a defining characteristic of omni-channel. Customers expect you to talk to their unique experience and needs. Small businesses have an advantage over the giants here because they tend to cater to a smaller customer niche and offer a much higher level of service. Use sales data to create tailored marketing campaigns and a personalized shopping experience with well-curated item suggestions and surprise offers.</p>
<h4 style="color: #46c0d7">Engage with your customers</h4>
<p>The only way to provide a personalized experience is to get to know your customers. Use social media to listen to their needs Also, be prepared to let your customer decide how often and when they want to engage with you. Make social media and commentary easy to use; let your customers decide how often they want to receive your newsletter.</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Favor quality over quantity and enter channels with purpose</li>
<li>Build trust through brand and price consistency across channels</li>
<li>Streamline inventory, shipping and payment with behind-the-scenes organization</li>
<li>Use customer data to create a personalized shopping experience</li>
<li>Engage with your customers through social media</li>
</ul>
<p>Omni-channel techniques aren’t just for the big guys. Small businesses can benefit from creating an integrated, consistent and personalized shopping experience for their customers. Do you have an omni-channel strategy? Share what’s working for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most customers who go into a brick and mortar spend some money before they leave. But typically only a small percentage of Internet users make a purchase. How can you improve your conversion rate? That&#8217;s the question that every merchant asks themselves.<br />
Site design, videos, and multiple product photos with different angles all have a strong influence on a customer&#8217;s decision to make a purchase from a website. But the payment page is another strategic point for optimizing your conversions.</p>
<p>David Chaouat, Partner Manager at Ingenico Payment Services, is an expert in online payment services. Here he reveals 4 golden rules to quickly optimize your payment page and boost your conversion rate.<br />
<span id="more-19414"></span></p>
<h2 style="color: #73bd43;">1. Elements of credibility</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s fundamental to provide an atmosphere of trust throughout the purchasing experience. If customers don&#8217;t trust your e-commerce site, they won&#8217;t finalize their purchases with you!<br />
Think hard about the customer experience that you would like to offer at checkout. If your brand is not very well-known, or isn&#8217;t yet a recognized name in the marketplace, you should consider a visible redirect to a trusted third party page (PSP or bank). That way you can rely on a known partner, and benefit from their trustworthiness (SSL Certificates, transaction references, banking partner logos, etc.)<br />
If your brand is already well-known and trustworthy, then you can choose an integrated order gateway where the redirect to the trusted third party is invisible. In that case, don&#8217;t forget the essential elements for the payment page: SSL certificate, the amount of the transaction, the transaction reference number and a trusted logo that&#8217;s well-known on the marketplace (such as a bank, PSP, Verisign, etc.)</p>
<h2 style="color: #73bd43;">2. Offer payment methods adapted to your customers</h2>
<p>When you let your customers choose how to pay, they&#8217;ll be more inclined to complete their purchase. For example: a Dutch customer might prefer to pay with iDEAL while a French customer might prefer to use a credit card. So make sure that your payment partner offers you the necessary payment methods, and that they are easy and clear to use.<br />
Then, adapt your payment page, dynamically displaying payment methods according to your customers&#8217; location or nationality. Don&#8217;t display every payment method each time. Segment your customers to include only the relevant payment methods.</p>
<h2 style="color: #73bd43;">3. Customize the page design with your store&#8217;s look</h2>
<p>So that there&#8217;s not a visual break between your site and the service provider&#8217;s payment page, you should do something to customize it. The important thing is for the page to be clear and fluid: just putting your logo in, and using your site&#8217;s fonts and colours is typically enough to make it seem smooth. If you can, think about putting a phone number on this page so you can recover the sale if there&#8217;s a problem.<br />
For those customers who might be unsettled by the redirect, you can also add a home button and links giving different ways to return to your site. Customers these days are better informed, and have come to expect external payment pages on sites. They&#8217;re no longer as unsettled by a redirect.</p>
<h2 style="color: #73bd43;">4. A payment page that adapts to every format</h2>
<p>Your site is no doubt already set up for different formats (PC, tablet, smartphone). It would be a pity to ruin all of your efforts by only offering one payment page format. The payment page must also be fluid and practical for customers browsing on their smartphone. It’s easier for customers to finalize a purchase if they don&#8217;t have to zoom and scroll to enter their card number.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you sell online, it&#8217;s tempting to want to carry as much as you can in your store &#8211; after all, more products equals more sales &#8211; right?</p>
<p>The more products you have, the greater the likelihood that someone browsing your store will find something they want or like, and buy it &#8211; right?</p>
<p>Sure &#8211; if your store happens to be Amazon or Walmart. But if you&#8217;re a small business owner like the rest of us, then good luck trying to sell that kind of catalog.</p>
<p><span id="more-19392"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288">What Amazon and Walmart do</span></h4>
<p>Amazon and Walmart have been around for years. In that time, they&#8217;ve perfected the art of being “everything” stores &#8211; it&#8217;s the very concept their brands are founded on.</p>
<p>To be “everything” stores, they have to buy in bulk, spend millions of dollars securing inexpensive inventory, sell everything at super-tight margins and expect to make up any losses through volume.</p>
<p>They also spend millions and millions of dollars on advertising to reach customers &#8211; in fact, Amazon is one of the <a title="Google Adwords" href="http://www.wordstream.com/articles/google-earnings" target="_blank">largest consumers of Google Adwords</a>.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I used the word “millions” a few times in the above paragraphs. Unless you have millions to spend on advertising &#8211; I know I sure don&#8217;t &#8211; it&#8217;s highly unlikely that you can sell everything and be successful at it.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288">What the rest of us (shouldn&#8217;t) do</span></h4>
<p>While most people new to ecommerce don&#8217;t make the cardinal sin of listing everything on their store, they still try to carry too much.</p>
<p>The problem with listing too much is that you stretch yourself too thin &#8211; think “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.”</p>
<p>So what do I mean by “too much”? Well, lets say you wanted to open a store in the coffee niche. A new store selling “too much” in the coffee niche would try to offer every coffee machine ever made, as well as filters and hundreds of different coffees.</p>
<p>The reason Amazon can get away with being a jack-of-all-trades is that they&#8217;ve spent the better part of 20 years nurturing trust in that brand image. A new store that tries to sell a similar variety of products doesn&#8217;t command the same respect and will struggle to win over customers.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288">Less is more</span></h4>
<p>In ecommerce, less is sometimes more for small businesses. If you&#8217;re selling something that can be found on Amazon, you have to be very good to be profitable. To position yourself against the bigger players, it sometimes helps to have a tighter product selection.</p>
<p>A tighter product selection suggests expertise. Nobody goes to Amazon and thinks, “Man, these guys are experts about what they sell. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be able to answer any questions I have.”<br />
In fact, because there&#8217;s so little product-specific information available on Amazon, an entire industry of websites specializing in product reviews exists &#8211; to direct people right to Amazon!</p>
<p>Now, if you head to a boutique ecommerce store specializing in one product line, you know those guys are experts &#8211; they&#8217;ll listen to your concerns and help you choose the right product for your needs. They serve the dual role of product review website and online store.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288">Niche down</span></h4>
<p>What does it mean to “niche down”? Very simply, it means to remove products and tighten your offer to respond to a more specific customer need. To understand what products to cut, you must first understand your customer.</p>
<p><a title="Andrew Youderian" href="http://www.ecommercefuel.com/inside-relaunch-online-store/" target="_blank">Andrew Youderian figured out</a>, for example, that most of his former trolling motor shop customers were actually looking for bow mount trolling motors, so he niched down from trolling motors to the more specific bow mount trolling motors.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve already got a store up and running, go through your orders and try to identify some trends &#8211; chances are some of your products are selling much, much better than others &#8211; that&#8217;s where your opportunity lies. Identify the need and focus your marketing efforts on those areas where you are already seen as an expert.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t got a store yet, go through subreddits and forums related to your future market to find common denominators or trends. You can start building your store around a need. Another approach is to cast a wider net when you first start out, with the intent to specialize as trends begin to appear.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #2f5288">Key takeaways</span></h4>
<p>When it comes to small business ecommerce, less is more. Once you have your audience and customer base down, then you can think about expanding your selection with carefully curated products that you know your audience will love and want to buy.</p>
